          <h3 class="post-subtitle">Instructions on how to report bugs</h3>
          <P>In a nutshell, the aim of a bug report is to enable the programmer to see the program failing in front of him. You can either show him in person,
            or give him careful and detailed instructions on how to make it fail. If he can make it fail, he will try to gather extra information until he knows the cause.
            If he can't make it fail, he will have to ask you to gather that information for him.</P>
          <p>In bug reports, try to make very clear what are actual facts ("I was at the computer and this happened") and what are speculations ("I think the problem might be this").
            Leave out speculations if you want to, but don't leave out facts.</p>
          <p>When you report a bug, you are doing so because you want the bug fixed.
            There is no point in swearing at the programmer or being deliberately unhelpful.
            It may be his fault and your problem, and you might be right to be angry with him,
            but the bug will get fixed faster if you help by supplying all the information he needs. Remember also that if the program is free,
            the author is providing it out of kindness, so if too many people are rude to him, he may stop feeling kind.</p>

          <h3 class="post-subtitle">Introduction on how to submit patches</h3>
          <p>how to submit patches if you find a bug or missing functionality. There are several options, which are described in decreasing preference.</p>
          <p>GitHub has a
            <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">good description</a>
            of submitting patches using <i>pull requests</i>.</p>
          <p>Note that quite a few of the remarks below also apply to using GitHub,
            notably those about dealing with packages that are represented as git submodules.</p>
          <p> submitting patches to a package:This is slightly more complicated because packages are git submodules and submodules are `not on a branch'.
            Therefore, you need some more preparation. Go to the directory holding the package you want to patch.
            Then use these commands to turn this into a normal repository. After that you can follow the same steps as above.</p>



          <h3 class="post-subtitle">Some indication of how development is usually done and how decisions are made</h3>
          <p>It is the project a benevolent dictatorship.</p>


          <h3 class="post-subtitle">Developing Working Mechanism</h3>

          <p>Source code management (SCM) system include:</p>
          <p>Git: A powerful, flexible, and low-cost version control system that makes collaborative development efficient and stable.</p>
